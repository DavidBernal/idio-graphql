# Code style
At the moment the package is written in modern vanilla JavaScript, using js-doc where relevant. The eslint is configured to extend [airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).

The project holds a prestigious test coverage and it would be greatly appreciated if you could uphold this, where applicable, with your PR. The project uses `mocha` and `chai` & coverage is implemented by `nyc`. If you are having trouble testing your feature give someone a shout on [slack](https://idio-graphql.slack.com/).
